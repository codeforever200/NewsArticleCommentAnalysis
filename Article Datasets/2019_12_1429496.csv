3.  Is it improper if that Vice President is a candidate for the nomination of President when such investigation is undertaken by the Attorney General?

4.  If the Answer is ""No"" to 1-3, is it stupid for the President to attempt to do himself what his Attorney General could properly do instead?  Whether stupid or not, is it impeachable?

Impeachment Process Against Richard Nixon

On November 4, 1973, Senator Edward Brooke became the first congressional Republican to publicly urge President Nixon to resign. That same week, several newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal, The Denver Post, The Detroit News and The New York Times, published editorials also urging him to resign. Time magazine, in the first editorial in 50 years of publication, did so as well, declaring that the president ""has irredeemably lost his moral authority"" to govern effectively, and that Nixon ""and the nation have passed a tragic point of no return.""",103925024,103925024,<br\//>,comment,1575301410,1,False,False,,,103925024,,9,0,[],0,approved,0,1575316475,Phillip Stephen Pino,52636209,"Portland, Oregon",NULL,NULL

In 2016, the Times ran a piece that said the FBI had found no clear link between Trump and Russia. Which was the exact opposite of the truth and then instead of apologizing for that coverage, they reflexively defended it.

The Judiciary Committee should focus on one thing only.  To do the right thing.  Maybe they should concentrate on having the Capitol Police arrest all those who refused to testify at the behest of Trump.  If that isn't a case for Obstruction of Justice, I don't know what is.  

In any case, Trump has proven in his own words that he did have a quid pro quo in mind and in fact.  How much more black and white does something have to be before he is iImpeached?

By the way, it isn't the Impeachment process that is dividing our country.  It is the collective closed minds of Republicans and the power structure that has caused it.  Impeachment of Trump will not be what keeps our Country divided.  It is the GOP and its minions.

What is keeping our Country divided is its persistent inequality in 
our Country from gerrymandering to Voter suppression, to lack of choice and upside down economics, including the Tax Reform Bill, and the continued lack of Separation of Church and State.

Someone has to speak up for those of us who rightfully fear Russian take over in our elections, Russian takeover in other aspects of our lives, our fear of the power of Vladimir Putin and his influence on Donald Trump, and ultimately our country.

This isn’t about winning or losing votes in 2020.  We cannot make it be that.  This is about the corruption of Donald Trump, the disrespect, dishonor, and total regard this president has for us.  

Witnesses have testified the truth, that they know the wrong Donald Trump has done.  Let the chips fall where they may down the road.

Do you think Fiona Hill doesn’t know what she’s been talking about and testified to?  And all the others?
