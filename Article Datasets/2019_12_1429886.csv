It was a bit disingenuous considering that as Joe Biden physically challenged this man with his aggressive posturing and body language, there are Secret Service agents always with the VP that would prevent any kind of physical altercation, even if the vice president initiates it. Rather than show passion in responding to the question the way he did, it  was more calculated performance for the cameras.  I expect more from Joe Biden.

Instead of calling the questioner a ""damn liar"" wouldn't it have been much better for Mr. Biden to calmly say the man was misinformed?  The reality is considering the political climate, the question of Hunter Biden's association with Burisma and his complete and total lack of any energy experience begs the question that this man asked Mr. Biden.
