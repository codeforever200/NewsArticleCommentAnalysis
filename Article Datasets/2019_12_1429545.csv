77,2,1575302811,"Let's also remember how former Indiana Governor Mike Pence helped facilitate the the worst HIV outbreak in Indiana history.

Pence first laid the groundwork for Indiana’s HIV outbreak as a congressman in 2011 when the House passed his amendment to defund Planned Parenthood. 

Then in 2013, Pence’s first year as governor of Indiana, Scott County’s one Planned Parenthood closed in due to public health spending cuts. 

Since that particular Planned Parenthood was also the county’s only HIV testing center, there was no longer a place for the county’s 24,000 residents to get tested.

Nearly 20% of Scott County residents live below the poverty line. Injection drug use there is a big problem, increasing the risk of HIV.

Then in 2015, local Indiana health officials began to report HIV cases linked to intravenous prescription opioid use in Scott County. 

Scott County residents were sharing needles to inject their opioids and nobody was getting tested.

The Indiana situation quickly spiraled out of control. At the height of the outbreak, 20 new HIV cases were being diagnosed each week, reaching a total of over 200 cases by the time the outbreak peaked.

Pence was morally opposed to needle exchanges, but reluctantly was pressured into allowing a limited needle exchange in Scott County, but only after Pence first went home to “pray on it”.

98,23,1575301799,"So this is article #28104872 since the 2016 Election in which I - a liberal, well educated, well paid, coastal city dweller - am supposed to find compassion and empathy for rural Americans and the problems which they caused for themselves.

Nope. Not happening. I hate what a stone cold heart I have developed, but here we are. 10 years ago, I would ask what I could do to help. But today? After three years of watching these same people gleefully brag about how their candidate is sticking it to people like me? Of cheering on his every illegal, disgraceful move as he works tireless to make their lives, and this country, worse? (All while they benefit from their extraordinarily disproportionate federal benefits, flowing like burst dam from blue states to red states, of course). 

I pray that one day we can return to caring for our fellow man in this country. I fought the demons of cynicism and spite as long as I could. But I too cracked.
