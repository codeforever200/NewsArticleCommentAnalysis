2,2,1575397438,"This TV series is right up there with my all-time favorites, each one done very well yet very different.

The Illusionist
Best TV adaption of a very good book I've ever seen. I love shows that historically accurate, for the most part, in settings. 
Breaking Bad
It seemed possible that at least some things like this could happen. It develops the characters very well and is a nonstop action thriller. 
Mr. Robot
Well acted, creative and it appeals to my inner radical self. Yea, I'd like to see most of the top 1% taken down. Spread the wealth around. Although, that's not going to ever happen.
