I can attest from personal use of continuous glucose monitors that Dexcom’s G5 and G6 CGM systems are superior to their closest competitor’s, Medtronic. They are easier to insert, more user-friendly to calibrate, and vastly superior in adhesive and sensor body design. I am currently using a Medtronic CGM, however, in part because I ran into similar IT issues with Dexcom in 2017 that the company was clearly unable to solve on a Friday night that magically resolved the next Monday AM. In my case, I lost all CGM functionality because I I upgraded my iPhone, and a “server issue” prevented me from accessing my app profile or resetting my password for the duration of a weekend. 

Dexcom makes a ton of revenue selling these devices, and it’s past time to see them focus less on profit-taking on more on basic 24-7 IT support for lifesaving medical devices. This incident is a symptom of a larger problem in the medical device industry which is that IT reliability and redundancy is not part of the FDA approval process.

But the real disaster is that Dexcom has developed an app that does not alert users when the database servers are not available or does not respond as expected. Such an alert would have been obvious, but Dexcom does not like to make such facts visible and possibly have decided that such information is unfortunate for Dexcom.

If you look at the most critical Dexcom app, the Dexcom G6 app that directly communicates with the medical equipment, that app hides signal loss situations for minimum 20 minutes to look better. Updates take place each 5th minute, so much can happen in 20 minutes.

Another problem was that the outage also took down:

- All 3rd party monitoring solutions like Diasend/Glooko, NightScout, Tidepool, Sugarmate, Xdrip, Apple Watch and Fitbit watches - that receive Dexcom G6 data via Dexcom Online/Share.

What has not been reported and is by far the most serious issue of concern is what caused the servers to become “overloaded”. I work in technology and anyone else who runs a web based system will tell you that any overload issue originate with someone sending data to the server or requesting server to the data in an effort to either bring the system down or to try and penetrate the server to access whatever data it holds. In this case, we are talking about the medical data of tens of thousands of customers with Type 1 diabetes who rely on this service.
