5,5,1575312616,"I believe that Jack, (RIP), knew what he was doing and the dangers that might come from it, but decided that “the game was worth the entry fee”.  I respect him for that.

Rehabilitation is possible, we should remember that.  But that depends on the individual and on society’s ability to measure true rehabilitation.  Bill Sands, in his book “My Shadow Ran Fast” (published in 1964), argued for indeterminate sentencing, strong rehabilitation efforts, and the inclusion of rehabilitated ex-convicts on parole boards.  The last because, he said, it is very hard for “a con to con a con”.  Mr. Sands was such a rehabilitated con, who worked hard after his parole, and eventually became a fighter for prison reform and for support for ex-cons to prevent recidivism.

It is better to not have people commit crimes, but no society has done this.  Therefore, what to we do with convicted criminals.  Centuries have shown that harsh treatment and eventual parole is not the answer.  Neither is locking a man away for the rest of his life without the possibility of release.  The death penalty does not work as a deterrent, and leads to the death of innocents.  Therefore, we must learn to rehabilitate better than we do now, and learn to distinguish real rehabilitation from fake.

True rehabilitation or life incarceration, is the only real choice for convicted criminals.

People such as Usman Khan are better viewed as enemy combatants who have not laid down their arms, rather than as criminals who are capable of reform and re-integration into a law-abiding life path in everyday society.

Mr. Khan was not driven by momentary passion or hatred towards specific victims, as a murderer might be, nor had he fallen into criminal ways, unable to pursue a law-abiding life through life's vicissitudes, as a pickpocket or drug-peddler might.

Mr. Khan regarded the society around him as alien, and himself as a soldier. He wished to kill people in our (to him) alien society, because he was driven by a sense of justice and believed that his cause ware pure.

The fatal mistake of Britain's criminal justice laws and system was to treat him like any other criminal, with the full benefit of reduced sentencing, rehabilitation talks in elegant Regency-era guild hall sitting rooms, no different from an errant member of our society who had strayed into criminality.

97,22,1575286880,"Thank you so much for this powerful, moving, and poignant remembrance. Lives matter. The words invoked to remember them matter. Both should and must matter more than the terrible violence inflicted on those who die. 

So often media rushes in to fill the air with the news of the terrible that it becomes crippling. We stumble over headlines  and pause over gruesome images and then fall back into apathy or despair. What does it say about our species that we fill our papers with bloody headlines and ghastly photos but so often forget the actual victims before they are cold? Too often we don't even know who we're really mourning. We need to be reminded of the actual magnitude of what was lost.

Jack was kindled to life on these pages. Instead of hearing about a ""fatal stabbing on a bridge"" I will choose to think of a young man, one of ""boyishly good looks,"" passionately sharing a poem with the incarcerated. The light Jack kindled, the goodness he engendered is his legacy. It casts an infinitely, incomprehensibly wider sphere than the grotesque violence of the man who killed him. 

The loss is ten times keener for knowing of Jack's passion for justice, but so too is the resolve to work to end this violence.

I wish Jack's family and friends sympathy and sorrow, and hope that the consolation of knowing someone so splendid --and knowing how many of us are now inspired by his life --is a balm.
