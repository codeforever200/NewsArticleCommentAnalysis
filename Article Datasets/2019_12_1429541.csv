RED OR ELSE 

It's is nearly impossible to get through to most Trump supporters on this (so many of them being fundamentalist religion adherents) because their leadership has them convinced it's not their own fault — it's the *rest* of society refusing to toe the same line they do on religious matters that's causing all of the country's ills. 

The answer, therefore, is to force their religious medicine onto everyone else, separation of church and state be damned, lest they themselves perish as God smites them with various plagues and pestilence. 

In other words, Democrats believe, for example, in the freedom for all individuals to marry and in women's reproductive rights...... otherwise known in the fundamentalist lexicon as ""abomination"" and ""baby murder!"" 

In reprisal, therefore, God reaches down from on high and strikes Republicans and Democrats alike — usually by ""removing His protective hand,"" as they tell it, and permitting deadly tragedies. Therefore, you must force everyone else to convert (or if not convert, at least to obey), and save yourselves. 

""Vote Republican or die,"" in other words. 

Now someone kindly tell me how you can reason with that.

Similarly if family can only be understood in one way, the right continuously assaults families in their sex policies. But to the extent that financial security helps families, the right also assaults families by continually trying to beat down middle and lower class income. And of course, the right wants healthcare to be inaccessible to the poors; screw their families.

Proggressives are the only ones hewing to recognizable christian values. They are the only ones defending the Constitution. Because they are the only ones who have made ending the corruption the founders feared, which has become our reality, an essential policy plank.
