The Chinese also invented paper over 2000 years ago.  Paper money and playing cards were also invented in China. 

Over 400,000 copies of one Buddhist collection was printed in the tenth century.  Confucian scholars also produced massive works that could be called the world's first encyclopedias.  

Nor did Gutenberg invent movable type.   The earliest movable type was invented in China by Bi Sheng in 1048.  At first movable type was made out of terra cotta.  Later movable type was made out of metal in Korea.  

Printing spread to the Middle East and Russia as a result of the Mongol conquest in the 13th Century.  It was only one of many Asian inventions that spread to the West at this time. Prior to Gutenberg, the paper was placed on top of the inked type and a cylindrical roller was used to press the ink against the paper.  

Gutenberg's invention was the use of a screw press rather than a roller and the use of ink that included linseed oil.  It is debatable if the screw press was an improvement over the roller, but the linseed oil worked better on metal type, which was more durable than terracotta type.
