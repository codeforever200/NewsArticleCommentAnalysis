Depending on a person’s personality and the crime involved, it could be easier to rehabilitate some people than others.

People seem to be born with the capacity to develop a limited range of personalities.  The personality that emerges, from this limited range, appears to depend on the person’s interactions with and responses to his or her environment.  While no personality is predisposed to criminality, if a person commits a crime, his or her amenability to rehabilitation probably depends to a large extent on his or her personality. 

In addition to personality, the ability to rehabilitate a person likely depends on the crime he or she has plotted and/or committed.  It could be harder to rehabilitate anyone who has perpetrated an act of terror.
