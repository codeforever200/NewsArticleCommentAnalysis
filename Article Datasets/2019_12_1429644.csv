2,2,1575434349,"Greetings from sunny Singapore, the #2 in the rankings.

I have been reading some of the comments and I feel quite compelled to say the following:

1. Singapore is a multi-racial and as well as multi-religious city state that also happens to be Chinese-majority. It's likely that the learners in the sample selected reflect our diversity.

2. The medium of instruction in our schools is English. This is an important point to note because all of us have to overcome the language barrier before we can start our learning proper. And yes, when you do come over to Singapore, please do not tell me how well I speak English.

3. Motivation from within is crucial to learning. In the absence of that, parents can force their kids to schlep themselves to private tutors but the results are not likely to be good. However, this is still better than not having a countervailing influence.

4.  At 8 years old, I still could not read properly and was in danger of being slow-tracked as a result. However, a steady diet of Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books from the local library helped me right my listing ship and here I am. It was all free, by the way.

24,24,1575424083,"As an American citizen who has chosen to raise my family abroad in Singapore and who has spent a lot of time in China as well, the reasons for America’s low success rates in reading and math are glaringly obvious. In comparison to the top performers, America puts far less value on its children, family structure and overall future. Rates of family violence and childhood neglect in the US are abysmally high- how can you expect a child to do well in school when there is no security at home? 

Parents in the US simply do not sacrifice for their kids like those in Korea, China, Japan and Singapore. Statistics on student loan debt and childcare centers show this well. 

Merit and performance are worth far less in the US than celebrity and popularity- kids are shamed for their intelligence, whereas in many other countries, studiousness has a premium value. We don’t have shooter drills in Singapore, nor drug pushers in school or gangs roaming the shopping malls.

1. Weak academic curriculum. The Common Core Curriculum is below international standard.
2. Qualification of teachers needs to be strengthened. Standardize teachers program and require applicants to have  B or above grades. For my two children, from first to eighth grades, only two teachers teach both reading and math well.
3. Poor teaching materials. This country doesn't believe good textbooks can improve kids' learning significantly. Singapore Math textbooks provide great learning materials. A good English grammar book teaches grammar in the right order with excellent explanations. I use the ones authored by Rosemary Allen or Anne Seaton.  
4. Homework and tests are not that serious. For math, they are mostly beginner level questions, and the occasional intermediate level question. Singapore Math questions range from beginner, intermediate to advanced. Advanced questions will lead the kids to develop a deep understanding of concepts learned.

This starts at the lowest grades, so that by the time a child gets to Middle school, the differences between those who got the extra support and extra push at home and those who didn't becomes marked. So marked that it can't be overcome.

Here is your best example; reading. The schools seem content with just having the child will learn to read and write . But the super-supportive parent will insist - at home, if not school - that their child be able to write well, with good syntax and extra vocabulary. It is the parent who goes over - line by line - through their child's work. It is the parent who has their child re-write it until it passes muster. The teacher cannot possibly do this kind of work for 30 children in the class room. 

So, almost by definition, those with a parent who can - and will take that extra hour every day to go over their child's work in detail, they will become better writers 4 years later.

1. The fundamental reason is that, public school education, is being run, like PROFIT-MAKING CORPORATES. With the belief, that, ambitious individuals with PhDs & GRADS in education-management, without any REAL TEACHING EXPERIENCE, can be made to crush & squeeze & strangulate & pressure & measure, subject-teachers, to produce A+ grades in READING, STEM, math and science. Students aren't products, like phones, or conveyor-belt products or services. 
2. READING, Math & Science subjects, can be learnt ONLY in a gentle rising intensity, at a pace and assimilation, at the student's age... in an interesting  and motivating approach, at the elementary level and gradually supporting them conceptually upward. Merely by dumping Math or physics or chemistry or biology, at the middle or high school level, for a semester, just like history or sociology or archaeology, because it's essential, will not develop the knowledge, skill or competence. Most often, the dumping approach, will permanently create an aversion towards STEM & scientific learning.
3. The testing system does not show the true situation, because, colleges are being filled adequately by children from wealthy families & private schools.

In reality, the best schools in the US are unsurpassed by any country in the world. Look at the incredible results of the students at our universities and the desire of international students to attend them. The real problem is the disparity of results across the US. We have great and bad sitting within miles of each other. Some of it is economic, others are parent participation and support of teachers. The US education system isn’t “busted”. The problem is that it doesn’t serve everyone equally and that problem is equally distributed between the people and the government. I am not saying that the solution is easy, but if you want your children to take advantage of the opportunities that exist, get involved in their schools and push the agenda.

97,22,1575411434,"As a retired teacher who spent 35 years in the classroom, I have to say that this is no surprise.  Like all the “reforms” of the past few decades, the most recent ones were developed with very little input from classroom teachers ... the real experts.

Very few of the “reforms” pay any attention to the students’ home environment.  Is it stable?  Is there enough income to support the family?  Does the family have (decent) health insurance?  Does the family have access to broadband (so the kids can do their homework)?  We’re the children read to when they were toddlers?

Also, very few of the “reforms” pay anything but lip service to the idea that teachers in this country should be valued, not denigrated.  That means acknowledging that they are, indeed, professionals ... professionals who, by and large, know what works and what does not work.  

Here in Wisconsin teachers have been attacked as lazy blood-suckers by political leaders.  Teacher pay has stagnated (my daughter, who works with high risk students, recently received he second pay raise since 2010).  As a result, the enrollment in schools of education has dropped like a rock.  Another result is that teachers are leaving the rural schools of Wisconsin and taking higher teaching positions in suburban districts.  The result is two systems of public education ... the urban schools and rural schools, both under-funded, and the suburban schools.

98,23,1575411434,"Hi All - This is subject near and dear to all of us as parents, grandparents, and individuals who care.  We fail because we do not pay our teachers.  Our social welfare system needs to be revamped to help those in need with proper incentives.  One cannot climb out of poverty if one is penalized for earning more money by losing housing...  Affordable health care is important.  There are tens of lobbyists for every elected representative in Washington, D.C.  We cannot redistribute health care dollars because Washington D.C. is bought.  Then we have the insanity of my once upon a time landlord (Mr. Trump) and Congress is total free fall animosity and poor behavior from all directions.  No wonder we are polarized.  Our kids suffer.

So one simple question...  What does one learn in math between 5th and 9th grade?  The same thing over and over again.  Teach Algebra, word problems, and geometry in 5th and 6th grades.  Children can learn it.  Those who cannot get a course load that will work for them.  But, do not settle for mediocrity.

And there are many reasons of the failed education system. Some are “Because the United States lacks a centralized system for teacher training or distributing quality instructional materials to schools.”

The teachers union control education system, therefore: 
A. Bad teachers are not retrained or disciplined. 
B. Abusive educators can not be fired.
C. Teachers salary and compensation is not attached to any performance. 

Curriculum has not changed in fifty years. 
A. Kids need curriculum that is relevant, interactive, problem solving, project integrated, and stimulating to trigger curiosity.

B. New programs must be added to the curriculum such as soft skills, communication skills, computer skills, practical life skills, philosophical topics in moral and ethics, current events, learning techniques, and in general skills to manage de idiom and solve problems.
