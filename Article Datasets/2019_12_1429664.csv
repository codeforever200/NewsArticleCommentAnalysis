I, Kamala Harris, want all Americans to understand that I will not let the United States government (US Census Bureau) tell me what ""race"" I belong to.

I will instead tell you myself that I belong to the only genetically distinguishable race, the human. My genome is 99% like yours, but thanks to my lines of descent that go start back with my mother born in India and my father born in Jamaica I have a genome containing information from them and their forebears.

I happened recently to learn of Times Magazine columnist Thomas Chatterton William's new book, Self Portrait In Black and White - Unlearning Race and perhaps he and I can discuss how Americans might benefit from unlearning race.

She broke my heart when she made that broadside on Joe Biden. It seemed contrived and abridged; when she arrived at the tag line ""that little girl was me"" I could hear the meme writing itself.

We claim to understand different times call for different social and political approaches and yet we attack people decades after the fact for taking the approaches those times call for.

And attacking someone for something she could not explain her own shifting position on, a couple decades later, in a more progressive community as a person of color herself, seemed almost to come from the Republican playbook.

My senator, Cory Booker, who I also love, disheartened me with similar confrontations of Biden but I credit him for subsequent statements repudiating that approach.

I've lost respect for Julian Castro for a particularly sneering and taunting attack that was more hasty and baseless than any I can remember in a Democratic primary, seeming to accuse Biden of senility when it was Castro who couldn't remember what he had heard ""two minutes ago,"" which moderators let slide but commentators afterward pointed out.
