A stand against what?  You mean a stand against the outrageous economic sanctions imposed on Iran by Pompeo and Trump, which were designed precisely to bring about the violent unrest which has now occurred?  

The supposed justification for the sanctions is to curb Iran’s “malignant” behavior.  The actual intention is to generate social unrest leading to regime change, on the ridiculous notion that the Iranian people will topple their own government in order to please the US. 

Why?  Iran has had the impudence of building defensive weapons (ballistic missiles) which curb Israeli and US malignant behavior.  It supports the Palestinians and Hezbollah.  Israel doesn’t like that.  Iran has justifiably come to the aid of its Shiite neighbor Syria where plans for regime change have failed miserably, humiliating for the US.  Iran goes its own way.
