Not just wrong, but a meaningless question.

There is no ""Europe"", which is why the E.U. and other European transnational organizations are in such serious disarray. The impetus to prevent a repeat of World Wars I and II created the will among Europeans to create institutions that would bind nations together. The Cold War essentially limited this to Western Europe, though the Warsaw Pact did contain elements of such.

In the past several decades, European leadership, in its pan-European outlook, lost touch with its own nationals, most of whom had no memory of the Wars. That leadership had a wake-up call it ignored, when the Balkan Wars erupted after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and Europe could not resolve the situation. 

In an aspirational rush of self-delusion, that leadership, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, rushed to incorporate Eastern European countries with essentially no traditions of democracy or liberal values. Not surprisingly, that has not worked out. Then came the vote for Brexit, an event which should have served as a wake up slap in the face to all Western leaders (including Clinton and the Democrats.) Very unfortunately, it did not have that effect. Instead of coming together to analyze the objective realities and develope a coherent collective strategy to renew a sense of transnational identity, the Western leadership effectively punted, not even realizing it was doing such.
