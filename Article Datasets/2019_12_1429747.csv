I'm not a practicing attorney, but I did graduate from a nationally-prominent Law School. If the Supreme Ct reverses Roe, a lot will depend on just HOW it does so, the legal analysis it substitutes, but the direct result would be that the power to legislate on the permisibility of abortion would revert to the individual States, just as it did before 1972. For example, abortion was NOT illegal in NY State in 1971; similarly in other States.

If that happens, some States will clearly outlaw abortion, and others will not, while others will place certain restrictions; the road is wide open. 

But the notion that States will attempt to interfere with their residents who seek legal abortions in other States sounds very far-fetched to me. The doctrine of ""Full faith and Credit"" would seem to compel anti-abortion States to permit their residents to avail themselves of actions that are legal in other States. Such notions really strike me as irrational. If some States prohibit same-sex marriage, they could not prevent their residents from getting married in another State. They might have to recognize such marriages. The situation in Israel is quite similar, on recognizing marriages that are legal in another country.

Roe v. Wade decided that restrictions on abortion violated the US Constitution. If Roe is overturned, it will mean only that abortion restrictions do not violate the US  Constitution. The SCOTUS couldn\'t do more than that. Congress could, of course, but why would it?\n\nMost likely, Roe won\'t be overturned, though it will be chipped away so much that it might as well be. But if it is overturned, the highly likely result will be that the issue just gets kicked down to the state level. Some state legislatures will decide that abortion is an inalienable right. Other states will prohibit it. Pregnant women in ""no abortion"" states will have to travel to an ""abortion OK"" state. \n\nUndoubtedly some state abortion laws would include a penalty for someone who travels to another state to get an abortion and then comes back to the first state. It will be necessary to challenge such laws, but I\'m all but certain they\'d be declared unconstitutional under the long line of ""right to travel"" cases (e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly).', 'createDate': '1575450851', 'updateDate': '1575596734', 'approveDate': '1575455479', 'recommendations': 1, 'replyCount': 0, 'replies': [], 'editorsSelection': False, 'parentID': 103945686, 'parentUserDisplayName': 'danarlington', 'depth': 2, 'commentType': 'userReply', 'trusted': 0, 'recommendedFlag': 0, 'permID': '103958864', 'isAnonymous': False}]",8,approved,0,1576447679,danarlington,64669543,mass,NULL,NULL

54,4,1575390940,I do not understand the problem that independent clinics have with Planned Parenthood doing political lobbying.  Their lobbying helps both PP and independent clinics.  Plus the independents benefit from NARAL who does only political lobbying. And the Religious Coaltion for Reproductive Choice.  All lobbying entities help all centers who provide abortion services and in fact help independent centers to concentrate on providing healthcare.   And PP is not prioritizing lobbying over services.  It has two separate arms which do both equally.,103943755,103943755,<br\//>,comment,1575389426,1,False,False,,,103943755,,28,0,[],0,approved,0,1576447735,Daphne philipson,17568792,new york,NULL,NULL
