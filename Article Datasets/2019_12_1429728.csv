1.  Arms from the US flood across the Southern border while drugs, driven by our demand, pour over the border in the other direction.  Both these activities cause chaos and violence, driving law abiding citizens to flee.  If the US controlled the sale of arms and stemmed the demand for drugs, these countries would be much more stable.  Instead they can thank the US for turning a bad situation into an overwhelming one.  

2.  The US has meddled in Central American elections for decades, planting false stories in the media and training military leaders at Fort Benning who later led death squads and carried out political assassinations.  All in support of wealthy owners of multinational companies.  This is still going on.

3.  After NAFTA, large agro-businesses from the US flooded Mexican markets with cheap, low quality corn, putting small Mexican farmers out of business, destroying crop diversity and lowering nutrition.

Truman’s attorney general, Herbert Brownell, implemented an immigration enforcement program in which more than 127,000 illegal Mexican migrants were formally deported to Mexico and another 3.2 million were induced to leave voluntarily rather than face deportation.

In 1951, Truman signed legislation which allowed farmers to employ Mexicans on a temporary basis, in the Bracero Program, as long as they returned to their families, in Mexico, at the end of the season.  But he did not want Mexicans or other foreigners coming here to live permanently, without our permission.
