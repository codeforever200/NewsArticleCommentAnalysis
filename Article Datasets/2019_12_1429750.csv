They had snuck downstairs to get any leftovers from the party the night before. Way back in the bottom rear had been hidden a quart of eggnog with a cup of rum in it. 

Although outrageously funny, remember that the little ones can find anything, from hidden in the attic insulation guns go hidden in the bottom back run and eggnogs.
