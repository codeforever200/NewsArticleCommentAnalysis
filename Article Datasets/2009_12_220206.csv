0,0,1264150109,"I find Evernote to be extremely useful for tracking my personal and business notes.  The indexing of PDF's and pictures is powerful.  You can work in off line mode if you create local notebooks, which is where most of my data is stored, so I'm not sure what issues the above folks are having.

But, we take it a step further by putting all the info you store to work for you in our free apps. For example, you can save recipes from any website and then have them all neatly organized in your recipe box (<a href=""http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/recipebox)"" target=""_blank"">http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/recipebox)</a> and then use our free meal planner app to create a dinner plan and a complete list of ingredients. You can also keep track of all your wine notes (<a href=""http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/winenotebook),"" target=""_blank"">http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/winenotebook),</a> keep a list of restaurants you want to try (<a href=""http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/restauranttracker)"" target=""_blank"">http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/restauranttracker)</a> or easily store all your travel plans like confirmation numbers, maps, places to go, etc (<a href=""http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/tripplanner)."" target=""_blank"">http://springpadit.com/appdirectory/aboutapp/tripplanner).</a> You can set alarms to send emails or text reminders. Other great apps include a budget tracker, a pregnancy tracker, a holiday gift planner,  a Christmas card log, a date night planner, and other useful tools to help people get organized.  oVerall, we see ourselves as much more user-friendly than Evernote as well.
