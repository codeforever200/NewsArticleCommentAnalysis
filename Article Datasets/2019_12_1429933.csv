Kellyanne shares George's contempt for Trump. She probably does not express her views much even in the privacy of their home because if she licenses herself to do so, it will inevitably leak into her public demeanor.

Kellyanne is very good at her job, which is to defend her boss. She parries questions artlessly, never responding to inflammatory questions with anger, and typically redirects hostile questions toward Trump's political opponents.

Kellyanne was the logical choice for press secretary. She probably did not want the job, choosing instead to work behind the scenes and making strategic appearances.
