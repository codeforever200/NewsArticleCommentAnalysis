Insurance fought back with more restrictions. Physicians and hospitals responded by itemizing services more. Truly, much has changed since then; however, I do wonder how much of the ""high cost of healthcare"" today is due to what has now become a tradition of inflating prices of services and products in the continual, annual profit-driven tug-of-war between the many sides of this industry.
