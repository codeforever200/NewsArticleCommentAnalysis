All of these shenanigans work just fine in the motherland full of conspiracy theories and crude overt fact bashing.  Unfortunately, viewed in the daylight in the real world, Russian efforts in sports, and politics for that matter, seem sophomoric, silly and sad.  Those poor Russian people and the handful of talented Russian athletes who would likely just as soon compete fairly.

The idea that the Russian government would get criminally involved in something so infinitesimally unimportant as Olympic success is shocking... Imagine a government that cannot support fair sportsmanship!

Acceptance of any degree of Russian participation in the Olympics will only serve to discredit further this broken and morally bankrupt exercise in manufactured pomp and pageantry, but that's not to say the bottom of the Olympics' reputation was not reached sometime in the waning years of last century, and now ranks with Cycling's Tour de France in terms of credibility.

Drug use is rampant in sport, especially at the Olympic level.
