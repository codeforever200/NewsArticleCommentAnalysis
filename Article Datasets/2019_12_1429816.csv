We went to Old Man Hustle for an open mic night.  When we walked in  the bartender in this smallest club ever asked if I wanted on the list . . . that's how we found out it was an open mic night!
A few dreadful, a few ok-ish, a few funny, at least one was hilarious.  All them courageous, including the bartender!
While my daughter and I sat and chatted at the bar, I said, ""I could do 20 minutes on your my mother, but I can't do the first minute"".  Over my daughter's shoulder I saw an eavesdropper's knowing nod.

37,12,1575401551,"Comics turn terrible into funny. ""Just give it some time, kid. If you survive, it'll be a joke someday."" Is this because human existence is inherently funny but we can't see the joke when we are standing in the middle of it? I dunno. Think I'll go ask Samuel Becket. Or some other infinite jester.

The line about getting married, then divorced so the comic could come up with a good joke reflects the reality that they have to live through bad things to use them for material. Really bad things, better jokes.

40,15,1575397565,"Amy, well done. I know what you mean when you say that you don't know why you keep going back to the mic's; and that perhaps it is a sense of community/fellowship with fellow-mic'ers.

Though I was singing and playing guitar for many years, it was only when I got past the age of 60 that I plucked up the courage to perform in public.

Last year I found an ('all ages') open mic in my town and I've become a regular there - performing and trying out songs. I keep going back because the community there is supportive. I'm old enough to be their father or grandfather, yet they greet me warmly and cheer me on each time I perform.

Lovely feeling.

Yes, I do some gigs now (some paid, some not) -- and I keep returning to my open mic spot because I'm most comfortable there.
