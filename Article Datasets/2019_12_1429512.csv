The World Trade Organisation’s appeals body will be paralysed in December with Trump blocking crucial reappointments of judges. Analysts say this may mean international trade disputes may never see resolution, leading to ‘chaos’ and damage to the global economy.

Because Brazil has been getting its economic house in order, at least according to the precepts of neoclassical economics, it's gained room to lower its benchmark interest rate throughout 2019. Any country would need to get its rates down from where Brazil's were. The prior rates were seriously impeding economic growth.

But one consequence of lowering interest rates is that the currency devalues. This is true for any country. The one goes with the other, and it's not a currency manipulation to accept the inevitable.

As for Argentina, it's an economic basket case. The writer plausibly notes that it's ""close to running out of ... foreign exchange"" because of failing efforts to stabilize the peso. Perhaps it's giving up because it has no choice, but that's not manipulation.

By themselves, actions like this warrant the defeat of President Trump in 2020, even if only by another Republican. But it's Congress's fault too.
