What a joke… In what universe does contact lens “fitting”, which took two minutes, equate to an almost $200 fee. Isn’t that the whole purpose of the eye exam and if not then shouldn’t insurance be covering it? What are they going to charge me for next… Sitting on the chair? Going to the bathroom?

As to the tremendous challenges this family experiences with their dad, a lot can be done to improve things. It’s a shame that the article is predominantly focuses on the negative and that it ends with a negative tone.

It perpetuates the widely held stigma that nothing can be done to improve the emotional and psychological well-being of elders living with Alzheimer’s disease..

As Joanne Koenig Coste the author of the excellent book Learning to Speak Alzheimer’s said:

“Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t take people’s dignity away. We do.”

This does not mean to suggest that the challenges caused by the disease are not monumental and that they can’t be extremely challenging. They certainly can...but where is the way forward and hope in this Times article?
