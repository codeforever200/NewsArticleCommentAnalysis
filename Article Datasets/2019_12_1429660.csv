There are many reasons one might choose to be eternally single and celibate, but the one I never hear discussed is:  maybe some people, like myself, are too overwhelmed in romantic relationships.  Maybe some of us really are not cut out for them.  People always say you can learn to be in relationship by working through your stuff, but that all sounds a bit too America-optimistic to me.  Plus, I work hard enough in other areas of my life, and I don't like working.

I decided to forgo romantic relationships when I realized that I had failed my whole adult life at sustaining them.  So have most people I know.  But it had never occurred to me that I could just stop.  Why would I keep doing something I fail at over and over?  

Nah, a romantic dyad is not the only way to love, to express love, to be loved.

I’m all for individuation in the Jungian sense, but even he said that it never ends, that we’re always on the way to becoming something else. And certainly, he believed that you can only actualize certain parts of yourself in relationship with another human being. The contradiction here is that actualizing those parts of yourself in a relationship come from letting go of your ego concerns — not putting your needs ahead of your partner’s. And for most people, actual sacrifice for the good of another is definitely not what “life is supposed to be.”
