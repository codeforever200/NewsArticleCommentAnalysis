Premise 1:
""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,...
Problem: That fails to define ""a well regulated militia"" or how and by what government entity it is to be formed, managed and funded.

Problem: That establishes no functional connection between a personal right to own firearms and a ""well regulated militia"". Note that U.S. security is now well managed by the DOD branches and National Guard units that don't require or allow troops to provide their own arms.

YOu had to be over 18 years. Had an interview with the police. The Police also inspected the security of the establishment where the guns were kept. Your Doctor was consulted. 

Condition on holding hand guns were for shooting competitions and you must belong to a shooting club. Unless you served in the military then you could carry them for personal defence.  

One idiot went mad in Dunblane Scotland and killed school children. Then the left wing luvvies started campaigning against handguns and the honest club shooter lost their hand guns.

Of course criminals are still running around with machine pistols!! and their is regular shootings in around the major cities of the UK. 


The honest club shooter still can not hold hand guns we are allowed rifles with magazines holding as many rounds as you want. Shotguns are limited to 3 rounds officially but the shot guns with multiple round capacity in a magazine are not controlled by the police. 

To sum up criminals have machine hand guns etc and the club shooter who used to go shooting 2/3 times a week in a club range is banned from holding handguns.

36,11,1575307613,"The “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State” clause simply states the rational for the 2nd Amendment. The amendment’s author wanted to ensure that Americans possessed firearms so they could form militias and fight against tyranny, just as they did in 1776. The amendment does not say the “right of militiamen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,” which is what it would say if the intent had been to limit 2nd Amendment rights to members of militias. 

The 2nd Amendment says “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” The phrase “bear arms” means to “carry arms.” Prohibiting the carrying of arms outside households would be an infringement.

Felons can be deprived of their right to keep and bear arms because Section 2 of the 14th Amendment provides that the rights of citizens may be abridge due to participation in rebellion or other crimes. 

The danger in pretending that the 2nd Amendment doesn’t say what it clearly says is that we could pretend the entire Bill of Rights doesn’t say what it says.

The 2nd Amendment was unnecessary from the point of view of individual rights. It was  a contrivance authored by a reluctant Madison at the urging of Henry and Mason who were concerned that the Federal government should not have control over the militias which were perceived as being essential to the security of a free state (that is to say, states worried about slave uprisings).  It is an anachronism, or should be. Individual states should have the power to regulate in accordance with their own circumstances taking into account the practical reality that getting rid of 350 million weapons is not remotely possible.

Your understanding of history is woefully lacking.  \n\nThe states wanted control of the militias because they didn't want them to be used to enforce onerous laws the federal government might pass that could intrude on state sovereignty.   Also, as Scalia explained in Heller, the militias were understood to consist of every citizen fit to serve in a martial capacity and not just a limited number of men in each and every state.  Hence, it was understood to be a universal right and to an extent a duty to be armed in case of emergency.  \n\nThere was much more to fear than slave uprisings in a few states.  There were still Indian wars going on and settler populations were being attacked frequently.  \n\nRegardless, the fear of an overbearing central government was palpable because they had just overthrown the tyrannical rule of one government and didn't want to see something similar re-constituted.  Given the history of blood-thirsty regimes that killed millions in the last three hundred years and in particular in the 20th century, that was not then nor is it now an unreasonable fear."", 'createDate': '1575302572', 'updateDate': '1575306265', 'approveDate': '1575303195', 'recommendations': 1, 'replyCount': 0, 'replies': [], 'editorsSelection': False, 'parentID': 103924915, 'parentUserDisplayName': 'RC', 'depth': 2, 'commentType': 'userReply', 'trusted': 0, 'recommendedFlag': 0, 'permID': '103925357', 'isAnonymous': False}, {'commentID': 103927453, 'status': 'approved', 'commentSequence': 103927453, 'userID': 83529637, 'userDisplayName': 'RC', 'userLocation': 'CT', 'userTitle': 'NULL', 'userURL': 'NULL', 'picURL': None, 'commentTitle': '<br\\//>', 'commentBody': ""@Dougal E \nI agree the right was an individual one but my point is that it would have been one without the Bill of Rights.

That is clearly not the position take by Heller.  If you really want states rights to prevail then the 2nd Amendment should be repealed and states allowed to make their own laws.  If New York wants to limit the carrying of weapons in the city, a policy which has contributed to the reduction of crime, then it should be permitted to do so. If you guys in TX want to want to allow semi automatic weapons in Arbys, that's fine too. \n\nYou are right in this respect.

Of course.

It doesn't matter how draconian, illogical and nonsensical that law is.

The NYC prohibition on transporting a legally owned firearm (obtained after an arduous and extensive year-long permitting process) outside the city was patently ridiculous and and its only purpose was to make owning a firearm more difficult .  The City never would have budged were it not for this case, and the repeal of this law was solely to avoid the possibility of a Supreme Court decision that could clarify Heller to prohibit not only laws such as this one but also prohibitions on possession outside the home more broadly.
