Who could have possibly guessed?
The Jim and Linda McMahon show, has a new market.
And it's not really a ""small business"", is it?
No, there's billions to be made.
And take another guess, at who's also closely tied to Professional Wrestling?
Yes, that's right - Trump.

Trump first learned how to fire up a crowd, at the wrestling matches that he made guest appearances at.
For an Attention Junkie like Trump, the screaming crowds at a WWE match were like heroin to a drug addict.
He HAD to have it.

So now we have the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who aspires to become the most brutal dictator on the planet, finding another way to bribe the President of the United States.
