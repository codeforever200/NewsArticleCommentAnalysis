For every Ohio or Alabama or Clemson, there are 50 football programs losing millions of dollars because they all think they can hit the jackpot.  And the ads for everything but football and basketball are de minimis.\n\nAlso - aren\'t there better ways to draw kids to your school - like improving the school?  I\'ve never seen a TV ad for Harvard, Yale, Princeton . . . yet they get plenty of applicants.

Very few sports programs run in the black financially, despite what’s commonly believed. They’re a drain on resources. What’s more, the system is rife with corruption, from lowering athletes’ academic standards for admission, to grossly watering down their scholastic experience once enrolled, to discarding them if injured - often with no degree. And along with all that, a nasty overtone of racism and exploitation of low income kids.

Women recognizing they want cool things too isn’t a bad thing. And raising the bar on a collegiate level will assist or even force woman’s professional leagues to act accordingly.
