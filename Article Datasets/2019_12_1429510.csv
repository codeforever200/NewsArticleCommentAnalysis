It is true that climate change is the most pressing problem of our age, a problem which Klein tries to address.

But she doesn't seem to understand the science behind climate change.

Klein seems to deny that climate change is primarily caused by population growth.  There would be no serious climate change problem if world population was less than a billion, as it was when Malthus issued his first warnings in 1798,  When ""Limits to Growth"" was published in 1972, world population stood at roughly half the current level.

Time is running out.  I wish that one of the Democratic candidates would tell the truth about climate change:  Any program to mitigate its effects must include a program to provide family planning to the world's poor.

64,14,1575311546,"Perhaps the best outcome for the primaries would be if no candidate gets nearly enough delegates to capture the nomination. That  result would do three beneficial things for the Democratic Party. 

First, it would mean that the nomination decision would be made at the convention; and although that makes old-style political brokering possible, it also makes it possible to make a more reasoned political judgment--one not dominated by social media ads and untruths--about who would be the best candidate to beat Trump based in part on which issues are most important in the voters' eyes.

Second, the convention takes place July 13-16, which is much closer to the November election and would allow for more timely and accurate judgment about issues important to voters close to the election. It would also make possible a better judgment about which candidate would be most effective campaigners on those issues. 

Third, picking the candidate in late July deprives Trump of a smear-campaign target until about 3 months before the election.

There is no way to improve the chances of such a ""conventional"" outcome to the primary season.
