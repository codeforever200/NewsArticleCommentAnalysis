(We, the citizens, are supposed to be clients, served by the people who's salaries we pay - when's the last time you felt like an actual client when interacting with a government agency?)

There are now virtually no aspects of our lives that are not in some way influenced, if not outright controlled, by our government, and a lot of the politicians in power (and those who want to be in power), want it to actually get bigger - even much bigger. To spend at scales unprecedented in human history. 

Yes, the founders did not want a demagogue, but they were far more concerned with where the central source of power was, and they placed it firmly on the individual.

They must use every strategy and tactic to remain in power. It's all or nothing for them.

But if they can keep control of the reins of political power, the day of full reckoning can be put off for years, maybe decades.

Every mature culture in the world has gone through it, in fact in several historical cycles (e.g: Pax Romana to Dark Ages to Renaissance, just to name one). America itself has undergone at least one cycle manifest in the civil war. Great peoples come together, form great nations, form long peaceful periods of growth only to succumb finally to internal differences. Freud called it the 'narcissism of small differences'. Idealistic egalitarianism is a pipe dream that has only ever existed in small pockets (e.g: Scandinavia, for the past few decades). In a way America is the last to arrive on the scene. While it may be the world's oldest democracy, it's the world's newest 'People'. It's current polity has existed for a short duration in human civilization's history. 

If the arc of history follows, this portends either widespread violence, not unlike civil war or a sociopolitical secession movement effectively creating more than one country.
