I asked the nurses for lidocaine so that I could give him a local before putting in the stitches, and they said he didn't need that.  I argued with them for a bit, but they were adamant (they'd encountered this problem with all prior peds residents).  So I asked him if he had had this all done before, and he said he had.  I asked if he needed any medicine, and he didn't think he did.  I told him I was going to sew up his head to make the bleeding stop and to tell me right away if I was hurting him.

Same subjects were sleep deprived and the experiment repeated the next day--and they required more codeine in order to numb the same measured amount of pain. 

The study seems to suggest that when we are sleep deprived our natural endorphin receptors are less effective. Why? Maybe because sleep deprivation for cavemen equaled  a dangerous situation--flood, famine, attack by an enemy group--and therefore the body dampens endorphin receptors to make the sleep deprived person in danger more vigilant.

Pain is also an essential part of being a living animal. We experience pain because it helps us survive. Those without pain sensation can end up chewing off their own tongue in infancy as soon as they grow teeth.

27,2,1576098816,"This article seems to espouse two conflicting views regarding pain, which is confusing.

View 1 is that ""one thing we tend to believe about pain, but is wrong, is that it always stems from a single, fixable source"". I assume ""fixable"" means truly isolable, rather than a problem that can be fixed, as with removing a tumor. I agree with this, but for the statement to be meaningful, the reader has to understand the implicit metaphysics, that what we consider to be one thing could be considered many, what we consider to be static is always changing. I believe this is true of everything, or at least everything in our experience, and doesn't only apply to pain. I think if this view is misunderstood, it can lead people to absurd views such as that removing a tumor will not remove the pain. (Though it is not true that removing a tumor will necessarily remove the pain - there is no necessary outcome, given complexity).

View 1 is contradicted by View 2, that ""In truth, pain is in our brain"". There is no amount of explanation of the non-singular, non-fixable nature of the brain that can erase the radical dualism of this claim. Not only mind/body dualism, but brain/body dualism!

Why do we feel acute pain when we sprain an ankle, break a bone, or get a deep laceration? Inflammation of tissue and damage to nerves. the body communicates to the brain that we are injured. Sure, those nerves are not dedicated “pain nerves,” but they transmit sensory data, so our brains know we need to protect the injured area. We are mammals, so like any injured animal we feel hampered and unsafe when injured. So acute pain is real, and useful. But what about “chronic” pain that has a physical source? That is just as real. 

I suffered for years from neck muscle spasms, upper back pain, neuralgia that extended into my arm, and the almost daily complex migraines that all of this triggered. I believed this was a chronic pain loop that my body created in response to my emotional trauma, because that is what I was told. But then I had a benign cyst removed from the base of my neck, next to my spine. My “pain loop” and spasms disappeared, completely and immediately. The cyst had been pushing on a nerve all of that time, for years. And no doctor, physical therapist, or massage therapist had thought to make the connection, even though the cyst was visible and sitting right up against my spine.

69,19,1575558580,"Pain is designed by Nature for survival. If we focus our attention, attention being the key word here on the pain, we increase the pain. If the attention is directed to something else, like a secure environment, or music, or anything relaxing other than the source than it can be lessened, based on your ability to keep the focus off of the pain. We can make any human condition better or worse based on how much attention we give it. If emotions are allowed to replace sound judgment than the outcome can be greatly exaggerated. Understanding how much attention we give any pain is crucial to stabilizing it. In combat or emergency situations, pain can be diverted to an extent that the attention is allowed by practice of diverting the focus.

Philosophy's ""naive realism"" says true/real sensory experiences copy the world as it is. But our bodies are R2T2T2--twice Receivers, Transformers/Interpreters, Transmitters. 

Sensory organs Receive external input (light waves, sound waves, gases etc.) Transform them into electrical waves and Transmitted to a brain; it Receives, Transforms and Transmits waves--down the spinal chord and into the atmosphere.  

Brains also Transform/Interprets inputs as signs/representations of what is happening on/in/out of our bodies. 

These are often ""projected"" as if happening at the input source: colors, sounds experienced as ""out there,"" flavors in the food, itches, tickles and pains as on or in the body. Synesthesia is multiple reception.

""Referred pain""-- is deceptive--experienced elsewhere; so is ""phantom limb"" pain--projected to newly missing limbs--because the brain is still navigating with a old body-map.

Every muscle in that area of my body, as well as into my torso was contracted, holding onto the trauma at the moment of impact. X-rays showed arthritis in my neck. Most people would jump to the conclusion that must be the problem. I said, ""So? I didn't develop arthritis in 24 hours. What's the real problem?"" To which no one had an answer, other than bodywork, stretches and strengthening. Nothing helped. It got worse to the point it that just to stand and walk was excruciatingly painful.

Then I discovered Clinical Somatics. I learned how the brain controls what the body does. I had been getting worse because standard protocols were fighting my nervous system with force and over effort, making my body contract more. With Somatics I learned simple movements called pandiculations. These simple, gentle movements retrained my brain to release my muscles to their natural resting length. Instead of trying to change the body, I learned to change my brain and take back voluntary control of how my body functions. 

We *learn* our motor patterns, good and bad, and since the brain is ""plastic"" we can learn new skills at any age! 

I could have given up, habituated not only my pain patterns, but my thinking patterns as well. Somatics is all about choices. I chose to get better, with time, patience, curiosity and love. You can too.
