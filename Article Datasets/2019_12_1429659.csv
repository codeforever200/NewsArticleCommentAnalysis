As our lives get longer, the prospect of ""until death do us part"" seems more and more illusory unless there is a binding and mutually shared goal such as raising children.  Even then, as a 58 year old divorced father, successfully raising kids doesn't guarantee that we will want to stay together for our entire lives.  

The planet is getting trashed.  Our longer lives means added years of increasingly unreliable employment.  The lack of wealth flowing to to the working class means that many of us feel economically insecure.  It all adds up to less confidence to have children which means that we don't need to get married.

I cannot devote a lot of time to this comment, but I will say that I don't think liberals are against marriage, but they certainly aren't FOR marriage -- it being just one option among many in the anything-goes, relativist cultural world they inhabit.

The Great Depression did, in fact, see marriages drop. But it just pushed them back. Values didn't decline simply due to economic hardship, and marriages formed therein tended to last (see the data). When marriage is expected, people will largely get married. When not, not. Values aren't a kind of Marxian ephemera, which is the way most leftists kinda-sorta see them, if the truth be told.

(Note that anti-materialist progressives propose all-materialist solutions.) It isn't that people don't see the downsides of neoliberalism; it's that progressives don't see that other-than-neoliberalism has problems as well. In their rage at the Reagan and Thatcher years, they don't see that existing problems made a turnabout all but inevitable.

Nor, by the way, are the benefits of globalized neoliberalism ever given their due (especially by the French, who seem to despise it, on the whole, the most).

Thanks to increased availability of contraception, plus sex education in our schools, fewer children are having children.(Meawhile, abortions have also hit a low.) 

In general, both women and men are waiting longer before marryng and having children.  Women ages 20 through 34 are having fewer children., Meanwhile, birthrates for women 35 and over have increased slightly.

Once there was a big problem.  People got married who shouldn't have, because they thought marriage was the be-all and end-all. Because it was the only path to economic security for women.

Now people have a little more freedom.  It is messy, but it is a great improvement.  Everyone wants a perfect world, but children of divorce aren't worse off than the very common situation in the old days of losing at least one parent in your childhood.  And they are better off than children stuck in a house with two parents who hate each other, or maybe don't, but really don't belong together.  Lived that -- it caused a lot of harm.

I am a woman who was raised as a devout Catholic in the 60s and early 70s. Many of us who rejected tradition then did so out the feeling of being straight-jacketed into stereotypical cultural norms that did not fit everyone.  Eventually my husband and I consciously married; I loved children, loved being pregnant and a mom.  But all of that was a clear and mature choice. You cannot possibly understand how many messages for young women there were then (and still are) that without a husband their value is diminished.  THAT is what many women I know rejected. 
Secondly, you underemphasize the difficulty of raising children in nuclear families.  I have spent decades working with young families, which has convinced me that we are meant to be a tribal species.  Nuclear families magnify dysfunction and isolation where that exists - much more rampantly that you may understand. These issues are worsened under stress. Families/children benefit from wider support and resources. Thirdly, I have noted that conservatives often use the word ""attack"" against their preferred institutions when discussing other points of view.  You are not attacked when others, due to their own life experiences and stressors, make different choices.  Our current socio-cultural-economic-political-ecologic climate is HUGELY stressful, especially for young people.
