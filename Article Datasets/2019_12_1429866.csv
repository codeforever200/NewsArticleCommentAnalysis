As a recovering Army Cavalry Scout during the ground invasion of Iraq and Kuwait, I drove a canvas and plastic Humvee through thousands of miles of  battlefields littered with these horror-inducing yellow cluster bombs.  Friends were wounded.  Often, the sands would partially or completely obscure the bomb, exponentially increasing the hidden danger.  Worse, often times the only way we knew we entered a cluster bomb field was by sighting what we called ""banana peels,"" the exterior of the larger bomb dropped from an aircraft that contained the cluster bombs.  Too often, I drove over the unexploded munitions, and I am happy every day that I survived.  The banana peels and the Iraq land mines were and remain extraordinary horrors of war.  They need to be identified and cleaned up.
