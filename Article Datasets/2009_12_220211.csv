51,1,1262255564,"I have seen in action micro-credit schemes run by the NGO mentioned in the article. My assessment was that they were counter productive. The scheme I witnessed would get about 35 women together to form an association. The NGO provides seed money to a central account of the association. The women borrow from the account on a rotating basis. Ostensibly they are supposed to use this money to invest in a business, but the loans are so small (never more than $50) and the loan period is so short (2 months max) that there is no conceivable way to invest in a business. Furthermore, the interest rates are about 10% per loan period (60% annually), which is excessive by any measure. These facts aside, the primary problem is that women were obliged to take the loan when it is 'their turn'. But, maybe they did not need it then ...maybe they had no investment opportunities at that time. None-the-less, they must take the money and pay the interest at the end of the period. So, as the article notes, the women have a large amount of money in their midst and nothing good to spend it on. But, spend it they do. They spend it on non-productive activities like an elaborate ceremony and are faced with repayment of the capital with interest at the end of the period. One colleague of mine had to extend a personal loan to one of these women (a member of his extended family), since she was not able to pay back her loan at the end of the period.<br />The money does stay within the women's association; except for the seed money which is paid back to the NGO at the same interest rate that they charge internally (not bad). The number of loans given under this scheme and the amount of total money lent make great numbers for the NGO's reports to USAID. This seems to have been the main motivation of the program, but it is clear that there is money to be made in micro-finance. Often, NGO's will form private, subsidiaries that are profit generating and act just like banks. Yes, they often take great risk and work in areas where transaction costs are high, but they are often highly subsidized by the donor community. For example, USAID offered each new micro-finance institutions in Afghanistan $5 million to establish themselves; $2 million for set up costs and $3 million for loan capital (again, not bad!).<br />Microfinance loans by definition are limited to about $300 each and are often much, much less. When people in the most remote African villages are competing in the global marketplace against multi-nationals to the same degree as we are in the US, it is not practical to think that $300 can create a viable business. We are asking these borrowers to be much more creative than any borrower in the most entrepreneurial country in the world.

If convinced of the merits of the project, the micro-equity investors would be able to buy a small to medium sized slice of the startup in exchange for some amount of cash to be infused into the project (which could be matched with a loan infusion based on some simple debt-equity norms, etc.).<br /><br />This has an advantage over a straightforward micro-lending scheme in that it:<br />* forces anyone seeking help to make a compelling case (a business case, if you will) for an equity infusion before he or she could apply for a loan;<br />* forces both parties – the “giver” and the “seeker” – in the transaction to focus on valuation issues, the “stocks” and “flows” on both the debit and the credit side and the changes in these the “stocks” and “flows” over time, and the needs of the micro-enterprises rather than what the seeker wants (its easy for most small entrepreneurs to come up with a wish list of what they want – as against what they really need – and estimate how much it would cost them in local currency terms, etc., but far more difficult for them to really estimate the net-worth of their micro-enterprises and the areas where they could a little effort and a little investment improve the way they do business);<br />* enables the “giver” to take on a more active and proactive, devil’s-advocate-cum-mentor-cum-director role and encourages him to remain committed and engaged over time – the system would have to allow the “giver” to pose a few well-focused questions to the “seeker” every so often (e.g., related to the cash-to-cash cycle time, the working capital needs of the micro-enterprise, the lead times involved on the supply- and demand-side, the scope for debottle-necking of capacity constraints, or for improving product/service quality, resource-productivity and -efficiency, and so on), who in turn would, in the effort to come up with better answers, perforce have to look at his or her operations anew and revamp or revise what needs to be revamped or revised so that the micro-enterprise would become more viable as a “going concern” over time;<br />* the allows for those would-be entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs to capitalize their accumulated and ongoing sweat equity contributions to the project,<br />* and so on.<br /><br />Yes, all involved would have to have some rudimentary knowledge of accounting and finance and yes, both parties would have to be less-insulated from each other. Online rich-media tutorials could help disseminate the basic knowledge needed to both parties and the micro-credit/micro-equity-based NGO involved at the “seeker’s” end could, for instance, help become the via media and the bridge-between in the transaction.<br /><br />My students and I would love to make this work in a more formal sense by putting the “course-ware” and the “soft-ware” together for a pilot project if Mr. Kristof or anyone else interested (say at the Gates Foundation or the Kauffmann Foundation) wishes to take this a step further.<br />",1353786,1353786,<br\//>,comment,1509452702,1,False,False,,,1353786,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1534863431,RK,59871598,Astana,NULL,NULL

91,16,1262249614," In order for people to save, they need 1) to have significant amounts of cash beyond what are needed to make life immediately bearable (yes, Mr. Kristof, for people who live in abject poverty and are struggling for survival, alcohol, cigarettes, gambling and sex are virtual necessities, if life is to be lived with any kind of zest); and 2) to have faith that their meager savings will grow expeditiously and consistently enough to make a real difference for their future and the future of their children.<br /><br />Neither of these two conditions is likely to occur in communities that have little beyond a subsistence economy.

I disagree. 90% of the world's population is poor relative to the U.S. Their daily existences are reinforced by an interdependence of people, where they can borrow goods and mostly labor services, in exchange for trust and mutual protection. This is a closed network with its own deeply seeded cultures.

96,21,1262249614,"A hammer is a tool also but it can be used to beat you over the head as well as build you shelter. Savings accounts can be a positive tool as long as the wealth accumulated in those accounts represents control over the means of production and natural resources. The biggest problem in the world today is that the world’s resources are not under the control of democratic forces. The world’s richest people are accumulating an ever increasing percentage ownership of the world’s assets.<br />I’ve seen shows and read articles about micro-financing and most examples of the businesses that are created are businesses that offer unnecessary goods and services to the rest of the community. If there is an increase in savings but unnecessary consumption increases then what good is coming from the savings? Now, on the other hand, if the increase in savings causes a community to gain ownership/control over that community’s supply of drinking water, for example, then that is a real benefit of the savings. Unfortunately, from what I have seen and read, drinking water is becoming more and more under the control of large multinational corporations.<br />Some people may think that trade of unnecessary goods and services represents an increase in the quality of life but if it comes at the expense of losing control over drinking water supplies then I would argue that quality of life has been reduced.<br />As far as I can tell, so far, micro-financing is just another meaningless sideshow to the real show that is the global oligarchs controlling more and more of the world’s resources.<br />",1353688,1353688,<br\//>,comment,1509452533,1,False,False,,,1353688,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1534863431,WKuettel,40670911,"Oak Creek, WI",NULL,NULL

What the chruch did was to give hope. majority of poverty is due to bad deceison re spending as for eg., in India a poor farmer will spend loan money on going to a wedding in a neighbouring village to show off rather than buying medicine for a sick child or investing in paying the loan back to the money lender. This leads to vicious circle of poverty and money problems which do not go away. Affulent countries need to save to give loans to the poor countries, instead it is affluent counties whihc are now drowning in debt and barrowing from china.
