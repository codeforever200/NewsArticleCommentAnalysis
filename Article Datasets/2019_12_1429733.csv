0,0,1575840052,"The Mandeville Canyon house and its remodeling are totally misrepresented in your article, unless it was intended as an advertisement for a contemporary interior designer. The home was always in an English country style. The beamed ceiling in the living room is original, as is the dining room with its fireplace and Dutch door. The designer may have willfully altered things, but he did not improve them. The home was a potential historic resource, possibly an early work by the architect Gerard  Concord from 1936(?)

1,1,1575781742,"The LA house belonged to our aunt, and we often house-sat for her during the 1970's and 1980s.  It was a Tudor-style home with a wood and brick exterior, and it was absolutely beautiful, inside and out.  It was a gem, and an historic Mandeville Canyon home.  

Most of Mr. Callaway's changes were not for the better.  The new stone facade is especially unfortunate-- more evocative of the Brady Bunch than the Cotswolds.

Contrary to the article, the dining room was always fully enclosed and is almost entirely unchanged, other than having a different Dutch door.  The living room is also much as it was, although the so-called ""half-timbered"" walls of that room and the entry way are different and cheap-looking.  Happily, the lower woodwork in both rooms appears to be mostly or entirely original.  The library, which was a cozy den when we were there, is the only room that is greatly changed and expanded, which is not to say greatly improved.

It was a wonderful home, and we loved staying there.  It is a shame that subsequent owners seem not to have fully appreciated its charms or history.",104034033,104034033,<br\//>,comment,1575781740,1,False,False,,,104034033,,1,0,[],0,approved,0,1581702307,badcyclist,56642970,California,NULL,NULL
