S.386 is an anti-American bill that seeks to increase the import of the number of STEM workers into the US, thus lowering wages and creating more competition for STEM workers.  Notably, she is *the only Democrat* to sponsor the bill.

If Ms. Harris had taken just a few hours to actually speak with Americans -- both the new graduates of STEM programs who worked very hard to get their degrees and to their parents who paid for those degrees and if she had spoken to American STEM workers and asked them if they wanted lower wages and increased job completion, should would have known that the bill is a terrible one.
