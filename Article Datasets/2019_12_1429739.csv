The leverage of wealth has concentrated power in the major nodes (cities) of the US economy, which leverage investment, and act as platforms for additional innovation.  

The disconnected, and smaller nodes gain less or lose.  It is false logic to conclude, without looking at the history, that inequality is invigorating and should be defended.  

Concentrating power typically generates problems eventually: control more attractive than innovation, funds flow on whims of the powerful or get trapped, the economy hollows out as the middle collapses; resulting in fights among the powerful as a few get more wealthy and other elites begin to struggle",103948215,103948215,<br\//>,comment,1575399041,1,False,False,,,103948215,,3,0,[],0,approved,0,1575405096,rob,79216196,Cupertino,NULL,NULL
