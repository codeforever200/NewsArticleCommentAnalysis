I've personally made some cash selling stuff online, and I learned a lot through the experience. I traded virtual items in a video game, and I ended up making $500 one summer just sitting at my computer. Each item has it's own supply and demand, and you can buy low and sell high, forming the game's own mini-economy. But making even just $500 required a lot of time and effort.

Rowan Winch was extremely fortunate that his online business was a success. Ever since technology has revolutionized our lives, teenagers all over the world have been attempting to create their own startup companies. However, Rowan was not successful on his first attempt.

This demonstrates that it requires experience and perseverance to have a successful business and that teens who are new to the internet will most likely be unsuccessful. 

I believe that online startup companies are extremely risky for teenagers to carry out. A negative effect that online businesses have on teenagers is that they can deviate the focus of a student away from education and academics. For example, Rowan would be on the Internet whenever he had the opportunity in school, such as during study hall. This almost certainly interfered with his ability to learn. While he could have been working on his schoolwork or receiving help from his teachers, he was on his phone, searching the internet for images and memes. Additionally, having a business can create unnecessary stress and pressure on teenagers.

I do think that it is accurate to call him a businessman because he is earning money and he is doing it by himself without help. I don't think that adults would think of him as a businessman because of his age and how he does business.

How often do you think people your age get into selling things online for the money they can earn? How much of it is about building online relationships with people who follow them on social media? Where do you personally fall into this mix?

I think that not very often kids my age sell things online for a profit because most of the time, they want to keep the item instead of selling it. I mean you don’t always sell things to people you know, there are now websites specially made to sell shoes and clothes.

Such as websites that sell clothes, YouTube creators, gamers, rare things on ebay etc. In my experience, it can be a tough way to earn money, although it is a great alternative to getting a job that is not through the internet. 
I have sold a few items on ebay, although a few sold, many others didn't. What I don't like about selling on ebay and getting money online in general is that it is not reliable. You do not have a constant paycheck. Things that are not consistent can become an annoyance in someone's life. For example, you can post things on ebay but there is no guarantee that you will get that money. 
Another aspect that I do not like is that it is not a traditional job, or at least the ones that I have been told to consider traditional. I think that in a traditional job you would have a steady paycheck and you would have to communicate with others which may be something that lacks if everything was done online. You get many experiences through in person jobs like interviews, dealing with mean bosses, other social aspects, and working for others other than yourself. If you only had an online job you may lack these important things that are life skills.

However, I and many adults cannot call him a businessman, at least not a motivated one, just for the simple fact he makes money  People offered him money to advertise on his account, and he took it. He himself states that his original intent in the account was not for profit, but rather for clout, online reputation and influence. 

It is evident that being an internet influencer comes with its risks, and is not a very reliable source of income. Rowan says he just wanted to have connections and be financially secure by monetizing what he likes doing, implying Rowan was committed to doing this for a while. So when his Instagram meme account was deleted, he said he felt he has lost his purpose.

45,20,1575303874,"I think Rowan's comment about feeling like he has lost his purpose is slightly extreme. I feel that his parent's suggestion to get more involved in his life offline is a great idea. By getting a part time job, Rowan would learn many skills that selling things behind a screen does not teach you. Some of these skills and qualities include people skills, time management, determination and drive, as well as physically working to earn money. I believe that the same thing would apply if Rowan were to get involved in an extra curricular activity. Rowan spent almost all of his free time on social media and browsing the internet for content. If he were to participate in an after school activity, Rowan would make new friends and be able to experience things from a perspective other than from behind a screen. If I were a parent, I would be concerned with my child spending most of their day staring at a phone screen, browsing the internet. I completely understand Rowan's parents opposition to him selling things online. Not only is Rowan's ""job"" time consuming, but it also can lead to trouble. For example, if Rowan's customers found that he was buying stickers right on Amazon for a very cheap price and selling them for a lot more, some people may become very upset.
