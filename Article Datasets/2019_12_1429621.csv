Concussions can be obtained not just through football but most other sports and while doing normal everyday activities. You cant single out football from the other sports just because concussions seem to be occurring more. Before playing football I think kids should be warned about head injuries but you cant just stop football. Football is America's #1 sport, all current players know the consequences of playing the sport and continue to play because they love the sport.",105012024,105012024,<br\//>,comment,1580862955,1,False,False,,,105012024,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1580871264,Carson Coble,108902509,"Hoggard High School, Wilmington,NC",NULL,NULL

I’m not trying to say that there is no risk of injury involved in football, but what I am trying to say is that students should be given the opportunity to play tackle football. If parents aren’t comfortable with their child being involved in a contact sport then they can stop their child from playing this sport.",104152087,104152087,<br\//>,comment,1576377412,1,False,False,,,104152087,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1576380856,Abigail Bowles,97406277,"Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC",NULL,NULL

You can get a concussion playing football, so let’s not let kids play tackle football anymore. Well guess what you can get in a wreck in a car, you can get a concussion falling down the stairs. So are you gonna say that adults can’t drive, because they could get seriously hurt, or kids can’t walk down the stairs because they might get a concussion if they fall and hit their head. No you’re not, because that would be ridiculous. 
 
There are so many ways to get hurt so why are we singling out football. You can get hurt playing any sport. 
 
I read this article and it talks about how football “is increasingly dominated by black players, whose families are generally poorer and prioritize the opportunities for college scholarships that the sport provides.” Sure this is true, but the article is making it seem as if these players are almost given no choice in whether they play football or not. Which is not true. No one is forcing anybody to play football, because just like any sport there are risks of being injured. I also don’t see what the percentage of black students playing football has to do with concussions. There’s gonna be injuries in any sport no matter the race of the children playing it.",104152082,104152082,<br\//>,comment,1576377332,1,False,False,,,104152082,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1576380853,Abigail Bowles,97406277,"Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC",NULL,NULL

I think football shouldn't really be a sport though in the article it says that parents of 7th graders are transferring their kids to other schools to play a certain sport. I think they shouldn't bring back the 7th grade football in Marshall Texas and instead let them play soccer or basketball. Football isn't that safe even if you change the rules or add more padding the concussions and brain injuries that come from the sport are dangerous and could really do some harm to you. I know a kid who loved football, he played every chance he got but he got tackled and had sever brain damage afterwards.......he never played again. 

i think its had an negative influence because of everything i listed up there but football isn't the only sport you can get a scholarship from either and I feel students should be more aware of everything and they should give something else a try",104013493,104013493,<br\//>,comment,1575652412,1,False,False,,,104013493,,0,0,"[{'commentID': 105012128, 'status': 'approved', 'commentSequence': 105012128, 'userID': 108902509, 'userDisplayName': 'Carson Coble', 'userLocation': 'Hoggard High School, Wilmington,NC', 'userTitle': 'NULL', 'userURL': 'NULL', 'picURL': None, 'commentTitle': '<br\\//>', 'commentBody': ""@Madison Everhart, I do not agree that football shouldn't be a sport.
