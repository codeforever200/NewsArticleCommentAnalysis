0,0,1582810014,"Singapore has been my home twice in the past so it holds a warm place in my heart. No longer a resident, I now stop in for several days whenever I can. Changi Airport is by far the best in the world...and aside from fabulous food, shopping, and the airport pool not mentioned here, your ID is checked 4 times from check in to boarding. At each stage it is fast and efficient because each gate has it's own screening machines. 

For an atmospheric swim and a good sleep, the short walk off the plane and into the Changi Crown Plaza doesn't get much better.

The Changi Airport experience is so far above the pack that there is no comparison with any US airport anywhere. The worst airport experience is that after the long international flight to Honolulu from overseas there is no restroom access until after a long walk to the Immigration and Customs Hall.
