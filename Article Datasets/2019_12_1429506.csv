3,3,1575844298,"There are plenty of needy people in the NYC area without having to go to California and other places to find them. There are many out of town readers of the NY Times, but those people can donate to their own local charities while local NY Times readers can donate to the Neediest Cases. It was a big mistake to add charities from other locations. 

I also wonder how some of the cases are chosen when the problems are self-made, as in having far too many children which is under their control. This is different from a case I still remember from long ago where a woman took in her dead sister's four kids on top of her two, which made for her great need. These other people may need help, but I wouldn't call them poster families for Neediest Cases.

It is a worthy cause but the cases should be chosen more carefully and should be NYC and its environs.",103947525,103947525,<br\//>,comment,1575397772,1,False,False,,,103947525,,1,0,[],0,approved,0,1575848963,S.L.,33339923,"Briarcliff Manor, NY",NULL,NULL
4,4,1575844298,"I sincerely apologize to everyone I am about to offend. I do not understand why the neediest cases fund includes paying toward a $57,000 annual fee for an undergraduate degree for a young woman who aspires to be a dermatologist. Is it not possible to earn a college diploma for less than that? In a city with tens of thousands of homeless people, is this the best possible use of scarce resouces? I just find it difficult to believe there are not people who are cold, hungry, or otherwise in greater need than this usage seems to me.",103959482,103959482,<br\//>,comment,1575459967,1,False,False,,,103959482,,2,0,[],0,approved,0,1575989165,Tina,62609020,"Charlottesville, Va.",NULL,NULL
