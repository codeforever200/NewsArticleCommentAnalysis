A job that Kerik was not qualified to even apply for based on the regs. which Guillani changed to make it happen.   In 2010, Kerik was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to eight felony charges, including tax fraud and lying to White House officials. There were other charges and a fine as well.

3,3,1575280822,"Psychopath killer Gallagher and his admirer Trump are a perfect pair and typical product of “the country with most arms percapita. 

Americans have a history of violence and global military activity and live in a culture of violence, where weapons are a symbol of power and questionable mental health issues.

Toxic cocktail,  a society that value and glamorise violence,  children and youth are routinely exposed to  in television, social media, and video games. When a child becomes an adult, will have seen 16,000 assassinations and 200,000 acts of violence on television. That’s how our children are numbed to all the violence and accept it as a means to solve problems. They imitate what they see on television and identifying with the victims or the victimised.

A typical Gallagher is a most common profile, reclusive, with relationship problems with others and without a family’s support. When someone with a personality disorder and a mental condition is in search of answers because this alienated person feels that he deserves something better and has access to a firearm, the risk of finding ""power"" with violence is present. This is not only a mental health issue but a social and political problem too.
