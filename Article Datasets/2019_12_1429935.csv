Trump stands out as an example of not just another Republican loser being undemocartically put into office, but a decidedly crooked Republican loser who will be impeached.

That's not all.  He may indeed set a new precedent in 2020 as the only President to be re-elected after losing a popular vote the second time and he may even become the only President to become impeached a second time, based on his past corrupt behavior in the White House.  Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Carter, John Lewis and others have classified Trump as an “illegitimate president” and rightly so.

Sorry, but that is not enough, especially the way Ms. Fredrickson has characterized Trump's offense. I suspect that the American people will fail -- utterly -- to get the ""bribery"" charge. In 2019, we're dealing with an uninformed, disengaged electorate. The crime in Nixon's case was an easy to understand, straightforward burglary. People were caught in the act and arrested. The setting for Trump's crime is a phone call in which a notoriously inarticulate president asked the leader of another country to announce an investigation. I don't think the American people will understand the severity of that offense. The point, which must be made and that the Democrats so far have done a poor job of making, is that Trump was trying to get another country to assist him personally in cheating in the next election. Trump was trying to subvert our presidential election. To assume that this would be Trump's only attempt to undermine the integrity of the election is to deny everything we know about Trump.

If the Republicans really believed this they would have led the impeachment process back in January of 2017. To call Trump a ""president of questionable morals"" is to give him far more credit than he deserves. His corruption is obvious and encompasses virtually every aspect of his role as president.
What Republicans meant was that a DEMOCRATIC president of questionable morals should be removed from office.

Clinton was guilty, but his conduct, typical of many presidents, should not have resulted in his removal from office (though I, for one, would not have been sorry to see him go). The Senate should have convicted Clinton on at least one charge and censured him. Scathingly.

However, censure is not an adequate response to Trump's many criminal and political offenses. Since Trump believes he is above the law -- a belief that clearly preceded his taking office and is rooted in his profound narcissism -- he uses all of the powers of the presidency for personal reasons.

The absence of witnesses and documents speaks louder than anything the witnesses and documents could say, and is all the proof Congress needs to remove him from office.

I don't like this. It is nonsense.

I don't want anyone trying to victimize my wife or daughter, and I've seen it happen that someone tries. I'm not excusing that, I went to war with that. I don't want anyone else to suffer that either. I've won lawsuits like that, when that was new.

The Democrats have largely - pretty much exclusively, actually - focused on the Ukrainian affair in these impeachment hearings.

The result? Predictably, the GOP has concocted a wildly false and convoluted conspiracy theory as refutation (it was Ukraine who meddled in the 2016 election), and its right-wing media ecosystem has gone into overdrive to disseminate such nonsense. Now this wild conspiracy theory is part of the conversation, confusing portions of the public and taking focus away from the real crimes.

Let's not forget that Trump is illegally enriching himself from the presidency each and every day he is in office. This is, at least in my lifetime, unprecedented. Not only that, it's even simpler to explain to the public than the Ukraine story, and efforts to refute such charges end up stinking of defensiveness.

Ask your friends where they get their news, I suspect the answer is either one source, or multiple sources with the same political bias. And let's face it, all of the mainstream media either leans left or right. 
What surprises me most is my numerous (all well to do and college educated) friends that don't see the corruption by Trump. The answer I get is we need Supreme Court seats, or the economy is great. 
It shames me that they are so narrowly focused. Trump is making a mockery of our values as a nation.While that alone should cause him to lose in 2020.
However the Democrats the Democrats need to come together and quit flying so far left of center.
