We depend on local car services, Uber, yellow cabs, Zip Car, and to a lesser degree because of the need to use stairs, the subways and buses, for getting around the city and the local area. When we walk anywhere in the city all we see are streets filled with parked cars. Parked cars are everywhere, everywhere, and every street pretty much all the time has one or more double-parked cars. We have reached a saturation point with all the private cars taking up all the public space.

I propose that New York City begin levying fees for any private car that wants (or to a lesser degree needs) to use city space to park a private vehicle of any kind, including motorcycles. The fee should be substantial enough that when a resident of NYC starts thinking about buying a car they will need to factor in the cost of parking.
