0,0,1575434221,"I believe that to narrowly focus on just the Ukrainian scandal for Trump's impeachment is a huge mistake.

Indeed, that particular example of corruption is just one of many similar actions, and to simply focus on only this is an untruthful and inaccurate  portrayal of this worst of all presidents. 

Trump's long history of financial irregularity and fraud---and his close  association with corrupt Russians----must be shaped into an accurate and very simple narrative.

And a crucial part of that narrative is Trump's strangely accommodating actions toward Putin.  The list of these odd occurrences is very long; from asking Russia to help with Hillary's emails, to trying to lift sanctions against Russia, the return of confiscated property....secret meetings with Putin, accommodating Russia in Turkey and Syria... is only a partial list.

Without question, the Democrats should be edging toward the charge of treachery and traitorous activity.  The Ukrainian aspect of this is only one teeny part of this man's absolute unfitness as president.

As important as showing the American people (and the rest of the world) the depth of Trump's corruption is to make the Republicans answer themselves for the enabling of these anti- American activities. They should start with Devon Nunes.

Do you mean the total time of the debate will be SET as in prior to the debate occurring, so that doubtlessly the Republicans will object to any SET time?  Or do you mean that the Democrats will determine will the duration of debate when in action, so that the Democrats may stop the debate after such time they think was sufficient to debate the articles of impeachment going forward, thereby giving the Republicans another opportunity to object and appeal, stall and delay the proceedings? 

My take is that it will be the month of March 2020 before any trial starts.  The Republicans will doubtlessly file frivolous motions and possible Supreme Court Appeals (it does not fit, procedurally, but everything about President Trump's term in Office does not fit the laws on the books).

Impeachment Process Against Richard Nixon

On November 4, 1973, Senator Edward Brooke became the first congressional Republican to publicly urge President Nixon to resign. That same week, several newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal, The Denver Post, The Detroit News and The New York Times, published editorials also urging him to resign. Time magazine, in the first editorial in 50 years of publication, did so as well, declaring that the president ""has irredeemably lost his moral authority"" to govern effectively, and that Nixon ""and the nation have passed a tragic point of no return.""",103929728,103929728,<br\//>,comment,1575317322,1,False,False,,,103929728,,54,0,"[{'commentID': 103945543, 'status': 'approved', 'commentSequence': 103945543, 'userID': 80612329, 'userDisplayName': 'Barbara Herbst', 'userLocation': 'Aurora, CO', 'userTitle': 'NULL', 'userURL': 'NULL', 'picURL': None, 'commentTitle': '<br\\//>', 'commentBody': '@Phillip Stephen Pino \nOnly a man with some semblance of concern for his country would resign.

21,21,1575331005,"There is a lot we don't know, but thanks to the regimented unity of the Republcans, we are certain that Trump will be acquitted of any and all items of impeachment. For many reasons, including lack of personal integrity, this new Republican party is able to control the behavior of every single member to achieve it's goal of unified messaging and votes.
Everyone can see that Trump is guilty of obstruction of Justice, of bribery/extortion, and of abuse of power. Trump practically brags about it. Every day brings new evidence of outrageous Presidential behavior.  Anyone who is capable of holding a job can see that this President is guilty of conduct that is unacceptable for any employee in any company. 
The daily lies, along with Trump's impulsive, poor judgement in national and international affairs should be considered as another item n the list of articles of impeachment. 
In any case, what Pelosi has started is the only choice we have in response to our President and his Republcans henchmen.

Most likely there will be a motion to dismiss and then possibly a majority 51-votes to dismiss, barring a new development that results in enough Republican senators wanting to proceed to a full trial.  Trump is on thin ice if his defense is that ""everything was perfect,"" and ""I was just trying to be sure the Bidens were investigated by Ukraine."" This of course is not true, per the evidence gathered thus far and because he already let the cat out of the bag by loudly saying at one of his recent rallies that ""the Bidens are 'stone-cold crooked,' including Joe Biden.""

The Republicans could return to some form of normalcy and select a reasonable candidate thus rescuing their party from this extremist positioning.

Democrats need to say and show: We'll ""primary"" the GOP Senators who vote for corruption the way the GOP interfered in our 2016 primary.
It’s time for Americans to speak up, to the US Senate. Arizona former  US senator Jeff Flake says as many as 30  GOP senators privately believe Trump needs to be removed before the election.
 US Senate will not come up with the votes, 2/3 of the Senate, or 67, to convict Trump of bribery and other high crimes?  That's that?
Trump has among many corrupt practices, enforced  government by intimidation and threats, and it’s how Trump has worked. Fine. 
A group of wealthy donors is certainly available if willing.  The money can be found. 
The 23 GOP senators up for reelection in 2020 need to be put on notice that if they vote in the matter of Trump to enable and retain corruption they will face being voted out of office. By their own party voters.  Persons of means and good faith can mount a primary challenge movement, centered on a message that the incumbent senators voted for corruption (those that do) when it most mattered, and should be defeated.
