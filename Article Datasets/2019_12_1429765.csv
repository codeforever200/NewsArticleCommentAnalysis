0,0,1575466851,"Demand for organic apples at our tail gate markets allowed me to look at growing my own organic apples, something I was unfamiliar with.
When I reached out to the ""experts"" no one shared my enthusiasm for trying to do this. The excuses were disheartening and pushed me on a path to do everything myself which I was glad to do. Tired of hearing the negative rhetoric, I decided to use my new orchard as a testing ground against conventional orcharding methods.
I read a lot of stuff including Michael Phillips, who has called organic apple growing, the final frontier of organics. I came to the conclusion that I would try to grow heirloom varieties that originated here in New Jersey for marketing and diversity reasons. For root stock, I decided to go with a standard root stock, Antonovka, which grows a very deep root system similar to the dandelion. I did this because of the changing climatic conditions in my area which include a lot more windy days. Plus I wanted the roots to be deeply established. Of course, growing this root stock means no production for at least 5-7 years. So be it.
My oldest trees are now beginning their fourth year. It has been trial and tribulation. I have focused a lot on the health of the soil because I feel that is the key to producing a healthy tree. It has been interesting to watch how the tree fights off diseases such as Cedar Rust. I have not encountered fire blight - yet.
My goal is to prove that it can be organically and I'm confident I will.",103960834,103960834,<br\//>,comment,1575466849,1,False,False,,,103960834,,8,0,[],0,approved,0,1580870755,Ed C,69998446,"Winslow, N.J.",NULL,NULL

So, 50x1500=75,000 (new)  vs 300x300=90,000 (old).  So higher yields with older methods.  So, there is something else going on to cause the move to industrial farming of apples.

Perhaps the trellised apples produce more marketable fruit? When you grow apples you need to remove fruit (apples grow in tight clusters) when it’s small in order to allow room for fewer, larger (premium quality), pest free apples to develop. It’s labor intensive work. If the trees are grown at human height, the fruit can be thinned more efficiently and thoroughly than in the large trees. The bigger trees would probably produce more unmarketable fruit because they would be less thoroughly thinned. The too small and deformed fruit can go to other uses, but it’s not generally sold to distributors.

We can search for a gene (or genes) that confer fire blight resistance and engineer it into popular apple varieties over a few years. 2. We can grow other ""heirloom"" varieties of apples that are more naturally resistant to fire blight. We can also try to cross these varieties with popular ones to try and get the resistance combined with the traits we like - but this takes time and money! It could take decades to identify and breed these traits using conventional (not genetic engineering) methods.\n\nIt is important to understand that heirloom does not automatically mean better.

The tissues and vascular systems grow together, and the two plants become one tree. The genes are not altered, for either the root stock or the scion. Genetically, the parts remain unique. \n\nHybridizers attempting to develop a new variety manually pollinate the flowers of one variety tree with the pollen from another variety.
