Two he wants to set the world on fire before he goes down in flames.
The consequences will be drastic. The U.S. will head to at the very minimum an economic conflict with the E.U.,  because unlike alliances with America the E.U. will stick together. At worst America will have lost Europe and will be left standing alone.

Russia's military budget is $61B (down 23% from '16 due to their rotten economy). They spend only 7% as much on War as all NATO countries combined, less than 10% of the US alone. 

Their GDP is 14th globally, less than Brazil, Italy, New York state and Texas. They're half the size of California and less than 8% of the US. By all accounts, their economy is in the toilet.

Are they that much more capable than we are that they're able to be a ""global threat"" while spending dimes vs dollars? Or (pause to don tin-foil hat) are they really a Paper Bear? A monster-under-the-bed that's not really there when you look, a Be-Afraid-Be-Very-Afraid illusion that the MIC and the War Profiteers rattle in the dark to keep us malleable and afraid?
