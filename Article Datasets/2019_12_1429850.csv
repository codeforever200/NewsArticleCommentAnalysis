The 49ers/Ravens game was the most exciting game of the year. I much prefer a defense dogfight over high-scoring shoot-outs with zero defense. And it was rainy to add more uncertainty and drama. 

The 49ers definitely have the best defense in the league with a punishing, fast defensive line; young, quick linebackers; and an underrated secondary who shut down receivers, prevent big plays, and had a hand in containing the very mobile Lamar Jackson. 

The Ravens also have a very good defense (though nothing compares to their lights-out 2000 D), and a good offense made great by lightning-in-a-bottle Jackson. He is already showing hints of his future as a pocket passer: he slid on a run, ran out of bounds, and kept himself safe by refusing to take the big hits that eventually hobbled Vick. He sees himself as a passer first; you can tell that from how he looks downfield. He knows a big pass play is more yardage than a big run. He can throw from weird angles (made a great across-the-body throw rolling right). He is fun to watch. And he fumbled only once this season and it was due to a brilliant play by Marcell Harris. 

Speaking of which, the 49ers have taken next-man-up to the nth degree. Harris came in for injured SS Tartt and immediately forced a fumble and recovered.
