He's asked me to refrain from my occasional critiques, but I do wonder: where is everyone?

6,6,1575358727,"Been a while since I’ve poked into the environmental ed world. It’s always had an important niche, with dedicated practitioners. It hasn’t hurt that in a controversial “business,” it tends not to raise hackles. I always thought, though, its methods and ecological lessons were underutilized, and was curious how it is absorbing climate change, as, like in some other even environmental fields, it has been slow to the party.
This is impressive! Janine packs a lot in: the cognitive, emotional, practical (even the gutters), feel, social, community, mental health, dot-connecting, wrestling with doom and gloom. It is not take the field trip to the nature center (as valuable as that was). 
In contrast, at the college level, at the climate change forums and protests I’ve attended, while they certainly have the virtues of, and we certainly badly need, the passion and attention-raising, there’s a certain amount of frame-limiting.
Never is it mentioned that climate change is a wicked problem, which the students are going to be dealing with their whole lives because—we don’t know all the answers. I heard a very simplistic Theory of Change at one the other day. It really isn’t a matter of if we just protest, lobby, and pass a law, we’ll be OK. We’re going to have to re-invent our way through this, in field after field, which includes means learning how to learn.
