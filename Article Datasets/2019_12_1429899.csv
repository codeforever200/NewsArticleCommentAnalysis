0,0,1575693495,"I have also adored Ms Andrews since I saw her in “Mary Poppins” at 14 years old. 

I enjoyed her latest memoir. Sure it had its low points, but she was after all describing her life at the time. I’m looking forward to the next installment. 

And for heaven’s sake, couldn’t you have featured a more flattering picture of her??",104014477,104014477,<br\//>,comment,1575654721,1,False,False,,,104014477,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/avatars/cropped-2a51351f815176b8d047f2e00fd4f5a8fc3c4f7116a33788c059c330e4c3aee9.jpg,11,0,[],0,approved,0,1578688894,Roberta,56021880,Half Moon Bay,NULL,NULL

3,3,1575653129,"As with most people, I adore Julie Andrews. And her reading list certainly shows that she’s a well-read consumer of literature and non-fiction. I could listen to her all day, speaking or singing.

Having said that, her new memoir is quite a slog. Her first memoir, “Home,” was a fascinating look into post-war Britain and the development of this legendary star.

The sequel is a nonstop discourse on depression, sadness, family separations, constant travel — relieved only by the sparse anecdotes about her many films.

I felt like I needed a vacation after reading all that drudgery.",104012447,104012447,<br\//>,comment,1575650144,1,False,False,,,104012447,,7,0,[],0,approved,0,1579309358,David G,2373247,Monroe NY,NULL,NULL
