2,2,1575296697,"So its come to this; ISIS just enjoys killing civilians, but the Taliban try to distance themselves from that, or justify that. And the Afghan branch of ISIS started from disaffected Taliban. Imagine how disaffected some will be if a peace deal with the U.S. is concluded. We leave (yes, I’m reconciled to that), then the power struggles between the two extremist groups and the ...still-contested government begins. And as this article indicates, more ISIS refugees from Syria, Iraq find a new caliphate possibility. 

Where are the comments in this article from Pakistan? From Saudi Arabia? And from Iran, since the Shia seem to be the  civilian target of choice. Where is the money for the Taliban, ISIS coming from? After...18 years, surely we know exactly who/what/where that trail leads. Yet never any mention, any discussion on these points.

We’re tired. We’re leaving. Deserting the Afghans, as we did the Kurds. Beat the women, behead the perceived enemies, blow up weddings...but don’t- enjoy it.

3,3,1575296690,"ISIS-Kurasan has been pushed out of Nangarhar. Thank you Nangarhar Local Leaders and local people who accomplished this.  Over 1000 IS-K fighters and family members have surrendered since the Mosque bombing when local Afghans led by their Elders pushed back. Big Surprise, this was not accomplished by American or Pakistan or Afghan Government diplomats.  This was accomplished by Local Afghan and Pakistan Tribal elders and Local Afghan Government Officials. Those Afghans and Pakistan surrendered will be repatriated back to their tribes and families and NOT to Pakistan or the Afghan Central Government.  Those hardened Foreign fighters told to leave years ago are being chased down in the snow blocked Tora Bora mountains and killed.   Nangarhar will always be a critical area contested as it is the gateway between Pakistan and Afghanistan and the riches within Afghanistan and the route to transport these riches.  America and the Central Government should start listening and supporting the folks who actually live in these battle zones. They have been there a long time.
