0,0,1575458606,"Farnaz's account on the events in Iran is very eye-opening, as always, NYT reporters are experienced, professional and deeply connected to the events they are covering.  This is why I support the NYT.

However, The Daily frequently shifts the focus of a story in order to undermine Trump.  In this case, if you want to criticize the way sanctions were imposed, you have to do a deeper analysis of how they have been used against Iran and other countries before, by Republicans and Democrats, when have they worked and when they haven't.  It is a complex topic.  Or you can focus on the Iranian people and the regime, and describe how they got there and potential outcomes.

But no.  Farnaz described terrible events, including the personal story of a young engineer that was killed after sending a video, and immediately, your focus goes to show that the protests and the killings were part of the Trump sanctions strategy.

I strongly believe that the re-election of Trump will be a tragedy for our country.  The NYT, who has a unique set of reporters and ideas, could play a significant role in changing the minds of those that today support Trump - through facts and balanced conversations.  Unfortunately, your bias of making everything about Trump pushes them away, and to be honest, lowers the credibility of your narrative.  

You are missing an opportunity to let reporters like Farnaz tell amazing unbiased stories.

Farnaz, keep up the great work!",103945575,103945575,<br\//>,comment,1575393272,1,False,False,,,103945575,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1575458606,Bernardo Rodriguez,88968636,"Santa Monica, CA",NULL,NULL

Have you noticed that in Iraq more than 400 peaceful protestors have been killed? Do you see a correlation between these two protests? Could it be...based on the recent Iranian secret files you've recently published that there is a connections?????? My word...could they be oppressed by the same ruling power??? They've certainly treated the protestors in both regions the EXACT SAME WAY.  Just wondering why since the revolution in Iraq has been waging for the last 2 months that that hasn't been covered here?

2,2,1575458596,"I found it quite annoying how the reporter, or the nytimes, refused to even mention the 1953 coup d'etat, especially at 17:01 when she describes the history of revolutions in Iran and then starts of at 1970...I believe it is absolutely critical in understanding that the sanctions that the USA is imposing on Iran is the SECOND time we have provided fodder for a revolution, for a government that we don't agree with. I do not agree with the Iranian government now, but maybe I would if it was still the democracy it was before the U.S. overthrew it in 1953.",103938325,103938325,<br\//>,comment,1575376791,1,False,False,,,103938325,,0,0,[],0,approved,0,1575458596,James,69495137,Ann Arbor,NULL,NULL
