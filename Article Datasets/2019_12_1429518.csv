22,22,1575425421,"I work with boys at-risk who have HIV. People do not understand at-risk means a spectrum. Suicide is at the top of the spectrum. Boys and guns. The gun is an insurance policy if things get any worse than they already are. Often, they'll hide the gun in their stuff if they're put in a foster home. Many kids in foster care will tell you the system worked for them. The suicidal see it differently.

If you can imagine (you can't) an uninitiated foster parent taking in a hard-to-reach teenage boy with a history of sex work who has HIV and a gun in his bag. It happens. My anecdotal experience is that the boys who have done sex work and who have HIV exist at the brink of suicide far, far more ubiquitously than anyone wants to see. They will inevitably have customers (called tricks) who are married family men. Toys in the backseat of cars is a red flag. These boys miss nothing.

There is a self-defeating gravitas in these relationships (many men will come back) and the men who have families will confront much anger the sex worker internalizes. Sex work is one thing with adults making adult decisions. These are kids who can barely form relationships among themselves. The trick has something the adolescent views with rage and envy. A family. Often, including a boy their age. I have never seen a scenario where an adolescent who tells a naive family about their father's attraction to boys turn out well. A churning revenge and depression.

39,14,1575332476,"Thank you for this important article and excellent courageous comments.      I'm a retired psychiatrist, who treated 25,000 folks and wrote 1,000,000 Rx, mostly for antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs.      Looking back in retirement, I discovered that our chronically over-active stress response is the common denominator for anxiety, depression, and all of the physical illnesses that make up out top ten causes of death.     This subject is rarely seriously covered in the MSM, including the NYT.    We have become a nation of stress addicts, which the social media fuels, and the elevated stress hormone levels keep us awake at night.     Our educational system is based on competition, not cooperation, which generates constant stress.    
I've written a free e-book available on the net, ""Stress R Us"", and PB/Kindle versions are also available at cost on Amazon.      The one subject no investigative journalist in the MSM wants to face is the impact of our human overpopulation (what I call ""population density stress"") on our children, which one brave commenter touches on.     We need to ask ourselves why one in three entering college freshmen and one in four American women are ALREADY on anti-depressants.      What I discovered in my research is that he brain chemicals temporarily replaced by anti-depressants are the very same ones used up by our over-active stress response.

I honestly think that making elementary children talk about their feelings and emotions early is a very mart idea. That way when the children grow up, they wouldn't be afraid to talk about anything as long as they are comfortable. With more than 80 percent of kids, teens and young adults being on their phone, you could expect new ways of bullying. Now with cyber bullying, you can't just tell your kid to get off the phone. It is not that easy. Usually, bullying on the internet can continue on by bullying at school, work, etc. School can be another problem. Students can easily be stressed out from school work. Who doesn't get stressed out of work. Plus, around high school is when teens start applying for jobs, joining sports, and clubs. Now, while it is their decision to join sports, clubs etc, parents should be more easy on their kids when they get home from school. We don't know what any kid can be going through at home.
