0,0,1575391782,"Black culture thoroughly drips, on way from New Orleans to Florida, with the music groove and the gun violence. It poses police on both sides of the aisle with both shades of skin color, implicitly asks the question is this a matter of humanity or is the problem skin deep? The white cop out of uniform that was helpful, the black cop in uniform at work That was shot for doing his job, the white cop who was harassing them, the black cop in uniform who was cool.  No clear answer is presented but leaves the viewer with à better understanding of traveling while black in this film’s American landscape. And the black who helps vs black that harms, somewhat reminds me of the Harriet story of helping the slaves escaping north. The film does go to the mind and the heart, it’s beautifully lit, enjoy.",103944812,103944812,<br\//>,comment,1575391781,1,False,False,,,103944812,,5,0,[],0,approved,0,1576918772,Spell,87485456,Mountain,NULL,NULL
