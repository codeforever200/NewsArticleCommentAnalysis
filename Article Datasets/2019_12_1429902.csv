1,1,1575652793,"After the first debate in June, many commentators talked about strong Harris performance.  I thought otherwise.  Either Ms. Harris supported federally mandated busing (a losing proposition), or was just opportunistic and wanted to attack the front runner.  Yes, she got a bump in the polls, but the polls did not show how much support she lost at the same time.  There is a reason two late septuagenarians are leading the national polls.

How can you be genuine when you get criticized for every single thing you say and do (e.g., ""bake cookies"" comment vs. being appointed to fix health care, for examples from opposite ends of the spectrum)?

This should of course be a natural part of growing up. But it isn't. Majority of Americans, including Kamala Harris, want people to come out of the womb with one point of view and never to defer from it. ""I'm always right."" (As in DJT).

If only there were an incredibly popular candidate whose campaign were funded entirely by individual contributors who speaks with an integrity that would turn Trump into salt. If the media gave Sanders the publicity platform offered to Biden the DNC would create an unstoppable Mechagodzilla of BernieMania. And yet the story we're told is that the party is in trouble.
